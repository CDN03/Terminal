# Web Terminal
This project is currently "under construction".
I am re-writing the entire code, because the old one was so bad written I wasn't able to update it.
If you still want to use it, then here's the link: https://terminal.nashef.ir/Old
## What's in the new update?
1. Faster and more optimized code (and way cleaner)
2. New commands
3. New system for registering commands (faster)
4. Easier for me/others to update/modify the code
5. Support for command line flags / argruments
